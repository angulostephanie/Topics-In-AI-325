AMST 111 Power and Identity
This course revolves around the theme of power. This course considers how oppressive structures establish and sustain themselves -- and face opposition -- at local national and international levels. We will begin by addressing the question how does opposition imply alternative forms of power visions of freedom self-identification and belonging? Using historical literary theoretical and social perspectives we will focus on the tensions between power's oppressive and liberatory tendencies. For example we will examine famous African American intellectual W.E.B. Du Bois's sole published biography John Brown; test historical case studies through academic inquiries into British and Japanese imperialism; and take an intersectional approach to understanding identity power and domination. Throughout students will build and develop their critical and interpretative skills through reading writing debate and presentation. This course is taught by Professor Jaclyn Rodriguez (Psychology) Professor James Ford (English) and Professor Paul Nam (History).

AMST 240 African American Women Writers
In the 1970s African­American women writers dominated the literary market. The novels and memoirs of Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, and Alice Walker were read and praised widely. Though the 1970s saw a surge in their popularity, African-American women had been writing since the nation's inception, as exemplified by Phillis Wheatley's 1773 volume of poems. Throughout its literary history, African­American women's writing has reflected upon and often challenged assumptions about American identity and experience, racial justice, and gender and sexual norms. This course surveys the long history of this literature and focuses especially on texts that supply world views inflected by the particular experience of living as American, black, and female. Authors under consideration include those mentioned above as well as June Jordan, Audre Lorde, Toni Cade Bambara, Sojourner Truth, Sonia Sanchez, Octavia Butler, and Evie Shockley.
